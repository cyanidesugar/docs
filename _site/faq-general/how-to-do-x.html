<p>Making your own buttons in LioranBoard is a little bit like programming. It takes some time to learn how everything works.<br />
You can start with something as small as making a button to change your OBS scene and slowly work towards more complex buttons.
This documentation should help you achieve that!\</p>

<p><em>We welcome new members on our Discord server to ask questions if they encounter a problem with their buttons or commands, but discourage asking for a whole custom button to be created just for their needs. In that case you’re free to request a commission instead.</em></p>
