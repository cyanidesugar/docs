Changes or adds settings to a filter in a specified source.\
Requires the same formatting that is used in the OBS JSON file.\
Easy way to see your current filter's settings is to use a Custom Packet command: `{"request-type":"GetSourceFilterInfo","sourceName":"YOURSOURCENAME","filterName":"YOURFILTERNAME","message-id":"6666"}`. Execute it and you will get back a JSON string of the filter's settings. Paste it into a document and extract the particular value you want to use.
{% include image_collapse.html w="100" name="filter_settings" src="filter_settings.png" alt="Find a filter settings value via Custom Packet and use it in the command" %}
Use [JSON string validator](https://jsonlint.com/) if you want to make sure your formatting is correct.
