Extension Trigger: `YT Live Chat Ended`\
YouTube should send this trigger a few minutes after your broadcast goes offline.\
This means you can no longer send chat messages, ban/unban users, update broadcast, get your broadcast stats or listen to the events, as the stream has ended and chat is now closed for all the viewers as well.
