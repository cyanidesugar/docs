`Command: Send to Extension - YouTube Live Update Broadcast`\
Update your broadcast's title, description or category. Broadcast must be live and connection status must be `listening`.
1. **Use a chat command**\
You or your moderators can use the following command to update your broadcast: `!update title XXX category CATEGORYID description XXX`. The order of the keywords (title, category, description) must stay the same, however you can only include relevant keywords. I.e. to update only title and category, use `!update title Playing Elden Ring category 5`, or to just update the category, use `!update category 5`.\
If you're using a chat command, do not edit anything in the button.
2. **Manually fill out the boxes**\
You can manually fill out the Send to extension boxes (title, description, category) and press the button to update your broadcast.  

List of all available categories can be found in your Transmitter in YouTube Live tab or by pressing the [**List Categories**]({{ "#listcategories" | relative_url }}) button. No global list is provided, as it might be different for each country.
