`Command: Send to Extension - YouTube Live Chat Message`\
Sends a message to your current broadcast's chat under your linked account's name. Broadcast must be live and connection status must be `listening`. Currently does not support custom emoji.\
*Please try to be reasonable with the amount of messages you send, as there's a quota limit (both for each streamer and a global quota that you share with everyone) and especially chat messages are not 'cheap' to send. If you exceed your own quota by spamming too many messages in a short period of time, you will be temporarily blocked from using the integration (as well as listening to events) until your quota is replenished again.*
