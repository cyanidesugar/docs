`Command: Send to Extension - YouTube Live Get My Channel Stats`\
Retrieves your channel stats. Also accessible from your Transmitter in your YouTube Live tab. Connection status must be `ready`.\
Stats are refreshed once per Transmitter reload. This button can be spammed as it does not make any API calls.\
All stats will be saved in the stack name you specified (if successfully retrieved, else the stack will be empty).  

**Stats retrieved:**
- title: `[0]stackName`
- channel ID: `[1]stackName`
- view count: `[2]stackName`
- subscriber count: `[3]stackName`
- video count: `[4]stackName`
