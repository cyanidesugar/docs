##### YouTube Live Transmitter
If you're going to only stream on YouTube Live, you should use the included `tsl_youtube.html` as your Transmitter. It only includes YouTube related integrations.\
You can also download the newest version of Transmitter for YouTube from [Github](https://github.com/christinna9031/LioranBoard-Transmitter-YouTube/releases)

##### Regular Transmitter
If you're going to regularly switch between streaming on YouTube Live and Twitch, you can use the original Transmitter included with LioranBoard or download the newest version from [Github](https://github.com/christinna9031/LioranBoard-Transmitter/releases).
