If you're going to only stream on YouTube Live, you should use the included tsl_youtube.html as your Transmitter. It only includes YouTube related integrations.\
If you're going to regularly switch between streaming on YouTube Live and Twitch, you can use the original Transmitter included with LioranBoard.
