title: "Source Change Settings"

Changes settings of a source. Not to be confused with item transform settings. \
Requires the same formatting that is used in the OBS JSON file.\
Easy way to see your current source's settings is to use a Custom Packet command: {% include selectAll.html text='<code>{"request-type":"GetSourceSettings","sourceName":"YOURSOURCENAME","message-id":"6666"}</code>' %}. Execute it and you will get back a JSON string of the source's settings. Paste it into a document and extract the particular value you want to use.

Use [JSON string validator](https://jsonlint.com/) if you want to make sure your formatting is correct.
