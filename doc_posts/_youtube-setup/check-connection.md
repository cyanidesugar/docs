After linking your account and editing the INIT button with your refresh token, reload your Transmitter. The status (both in your Transmitter and your Stream Deck) should change from `Disconnected` to `Ready`. This means your refresh token is correct and LioranBoard is ready to start listening to events once your stream goes live.\
Once the status is `Ready`, the following commands become available: **List Categories, Get My Channel Stats, Get Member Info, Get Subscriber Status**.
