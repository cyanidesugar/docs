Once you have downloaded the zip file, extract it. You will see the following files: 
- `tsl_youtube.html` - this is your new Transmitter to use with YouTube Live.\
  Read [How to Run Transmitter]({{ "/transmitter#howtoruntransmitter" | relative_url }}) if this is your first time using LioranBoard
  - if you wish to use YouTube Live with your original Transmitter (i.e. you stream both on Twitch and YouTube), you can simply install the integration without replacing the Transmitter at all
- `youtube_live.lbe` - this is your YouTube Live extension file. Please follow our guide on [How to install an extension](https://lioranboard.ca/extensions/install). Make sure you select `tsl_youtube.html` (or your original Transmitter file) to install it in.\
**Don't forget to completely restart (close and reopen) LioranBoard** as the integration sets up some OBS triggers that only update after you relaunch LioranBoard.

{% include alert.html text="<code>tsl_youtube.html</code> does not contain any Twitch related integrations. If you wish to regularly switch between streaming on YouTube Live and Twitch, feel free to use the original Transmitter that comes with LioranBoard." type="info" %}
