**LIVE INIT button**\
This button should be automatically triggered when LioranBoard detects your stream is live.\
**Make sure your OBS is running and connected to LioranBoard, as well as your Transmitter.**  


Once the button is triggered, a few things should happen:
- YouTube Live Status should change to `Listening` (both in your Transmitter and Stream Deck).
- LioranBoard should start listening to all the events listed under triggers in your Stream Deck: **Subscribers, Members, Milestones, Super chat, Super Stickers, Chat Messages, Live Chat Ended**.
- The following commands should now be available to you: **Send Chat Message, Ban/Unban user, Update Broadcast, Get My Broadcast Stats**

{% include alert.html text="If the LIVE INIT button does not automatically trigger and your status does not change from Ready to Listening, you can manually press the button yourself (after you go live)." type="info" %}
